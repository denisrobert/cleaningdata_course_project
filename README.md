# Course Project for getdata-032, "Getting and Cleaning Data"

## Objective: generate a tiny data set describing, for each subject and activity, the average value across a number of measurements of variables related to the detection of activities using accelerometer and gyroscopic data in smart phones.

## Running the script.

1. Ensure the script is executed with the current directory set to the folder in which the dataset is located (it should contain at least a features.txt and features_info.txt file)
2. Execute the script via
	Rscript run_analysis.R
or your preferred approach to executing R code.
3. This will result in the tidy data set being generated by default in the current directory as a space-delimited text file named cleanupdata.course.results.txt
